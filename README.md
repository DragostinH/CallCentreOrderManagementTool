# OrderManagementTool

This project is done using Vue 3, Vite, Bun as a runtime, Tailwind CSS, Go Lang for Backend and MySQL as a DB.

I made this to practice Vue 3 with Bun and also to learn Go Lang. It's an application where I see call centre agents using to assist customers that are phoning in to report issues with their groceries order or want to place a new order.

This has been on my mind as a project even before I had any programming ability and was only a call centre agent in 2018. The software that the agents were using, even though it was with an outdated UI, worked really well.

## Recommended IDE Setup

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)

  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Firefox DevTools](https://fxdx.dev/firefox-devtools-custom-object-formatters/)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration
